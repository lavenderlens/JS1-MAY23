## extension calculator exercise CH4

1. From the calculator you made at the end of Ch4, refactor it so the result is displayed in the DOM ina paragraph or similar tag, and not in an alert or a console.log.

2. Further refactor it so that input is taken from the user from a text field and not a prompt function.

`<input type="text" id="num1">`
