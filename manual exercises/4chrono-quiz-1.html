<!--
2. Add a heading of your choosing.
3. Add a script element just before the closing body tag.
4. Declare and initialise three variables to store three questions as follows:
In what year did the Titanic sink on her maiden voyage?  In what year did WW1 begin? 
In what year was the Qualification of Women act passed?
5. Declare and initialise three variables to store three answers as follows:
1912  1914  1918
6. Construct a for loop with a control variable initialised to 1, a boolean expression that tests if the control variable is less than or equal to 3, and that increments the control variable by 1 at the end of each loop.
7. Add a switch statement inside the loop that tests the loop’s control variable.
8. If the control variable is 1, prompt the user to answer question 1. If the user’s
answer equals the correct answer, display an alert with the message “Right!”, else
display an alert with the message “Wrong! It was <correct answer>”.
9. Repeat step 8 twice more for questions 2 and 3.
10. Save your changes.
11. Open the file in Chrome and test the code thoroughly.
12. How might this code be improved?
    -cut down on code duplication
    -display no of correct answers
    -give user option to start quiz
    -keep looping round a certain number of guesses
    -quit quiz
    -multi choice (great for validation)
